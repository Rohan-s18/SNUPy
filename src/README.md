# Source Code
## Author: Rohan Singh (and possibly more people)

This directory contains the source code of the SNUPy project. The source code is further divided into other subdirectories.  

## Datasets
This directory contains the source code to provide datasets that the API users can utilize. These datasets can be used to try out our Neural Networks or in other side projects without using external downloads.  

The datasetsare fairly standard and each dataset will be returned in different formats:  
  - **Pandas Dataframes**  
  - **Python Lists**  
  - **Numpy NDArrays**
